        <p>Born as Temüjin in the Khentii Mountains of Central Asia, Chinggis Khan is known as the first Great Khan of the Mongol Empire and is one of the most recognizable figures across the world. After his father was killed by the Tartars soon after Temüjin’s 12th birthday, the young warrior was guided by his mother on essential survival and warrior skills. In this desperate environment, he became ruthless, even murdering his older half-brother Begter to assert a dominant position within the family. These experiences taught him to value loyalty over kinship, a radical diversion from tribal norms amongst nomadic Mongol groups of the period. </p>

        <p>Chinggis Khan’s value of loyalty and talent were central to the administrative and military organization of his vast empire and ensured its longevity long after his death. Evidence of loyalty to the Khan and exhibition of strength bought the Khan’s followers vast wealth and land as his empire expanded. After defeating the Keriyan and Neiman clans in 2016, the newly crowned Khan insisted on an equal division of spoils to his followers. This egalitarian policy of wealth distribution allowed his to break clan loyalties and ensure full loyalty to the Khan, thus asserting his command over a vast domain.  Chinggis Khan formed a new and stable system of administration that intensified the power of a central command in a society where nomadic traditions dominated. </p>
